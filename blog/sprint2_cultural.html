                <h5>
                    What are my strengths and limitations?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    My biggest strength that will help me on my learning journey with Dev Academy is my background in code. Because I have a degree in Computer Science, even thought the concepts are new to me they will be familiar. I also love working together with people and I am great at dividing and delegating tasks, this is going to be very handy when our cohort starts doing projects together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes when I am learning a new topic I will move through the information quickly because I think I already know the gist of it, only to find that we have moved from a -> c and I have missed step b! This can effect my deeper understanding of a topic which limits me later. Although I love working in groups I am a bit awkward around new people because I am shy. This limits me because I don't voice my opinions straight away as it takes me time to become comfortable with people.
                </p>

                <h5>
                    How will I manage my workload in this programme?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Everyday I set myself a goal that I think will be attainable by the end of the day and I set myself some "stretch" to complete if I have extra time. Not finishing my set tasks in a day makes me feel like I have achieved nothing so I never set my goal as something unobtainable. I will time myself when I start and finish working and currently I am trying to put in 5 hours a day of solid work, not including all the breaks that I take throughout the day.
                </p>

                    How will I seek help in a timely way?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    MY first port of call will always be Google, especially for Foundations, someone has probably had my problem and solved it before. Secondly I would contact my cohort through the Slack channels. Failing that I would get in touch directly with my facilitator Engie through slack.

                    What do I expect from the Dev-Academy facilitation team?

                <p>
                    Support when needed during business hours, especially through the main channels - slack and email. I imagine they can give a wide range of support from bugs in my code, to needing to adjust my learning journey because of personal problems, to restaurant recommendations.

                    I have no other commitments currently, but in February I will be starting a Te Reo course from 12th February on Tuesday evenings from 6pm-9pm. I may need to leave Dev Academy slightly earlier on Tuesdays.
