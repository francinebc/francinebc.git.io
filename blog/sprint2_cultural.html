                    What is my overall goal for my learning journey with Dev Academy?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    In the short term I would like to get a job working as a Full Stack Developer. In the long term I would like to start a small consultancy or start-up with my husband and work remotely from either somewhere rural New Zealand or somewhere internationally near a nice beach. I want tech to support the life I want.

                <h5>
                    What are my strengths and limitations?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    My biggest strength that will help me on my learning journey with Dev Academy is my background in code. Because I have a degree in Computer Science, even thought the concepts are new to me they will be familiar. I also love working together with people and I am great at dividing and delegating tasks, this is going to be very handy when our cohort starts doing projects together. I am good at communicating honestly and to the point, this is also my teaching style. Because of my work and life experience I have a lot of teaching skills which I can bring to Dev Academy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I am good at communicating clearly and honestly, sometimes this can go too far and I come off as blunt and insensitive. My intentions are always good but sometimes it does not come out that way. Although I love working in groups I am a bit awkward around new people because I am shy. This limits me because I don't voice my opinions straight away as it takes me time to become comfortable with people. Sometimes when I am learning a new topic I will move through the information quickly because I think I already know the gist of it, only to find that we have moved from a -> c and I have missed step b! This can effect my deeper understanding of a topic which limits me later.

                    What personal skills do I want to learn or develop at Dev Academy?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    I want to learn how to work in a coding team in a professional environment. I have only ever worked in a coding team at University which I imagine will be vastly different to a workplace. I would also like to learn how to navigate difficult situations in a professional coding team. Although I have been working for many years now I have rarely had a difficult inter-personal situation that I had to navigate. I already have some teaching skills but I would like to develop these more during my time at Dev Academy. Developing teaching skills will help me teach myself too, especially for learning how to transfer code/tech knowledge to another system or language, which will be important once I start working in tech.

                <h5>
                    How will I manage my workload in this programme?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Everyday I set myself a goal that I think will be attainable by the end of the day and I some "stretch" to complete if I have extra time. Not finishing my set tasks in a day makes me feel like I have achieved nothing, so I never set my goal as something unobtainable. I will time myself when I start and finish working and currently I am trying to put in 5 hours a day of solid work, not including all the breaks that I take throughout the day. Because we are learning so much new information I need to make sure I break up my time with many short breaks so I don't get overloaded.

                </h5>
                <p>
                    My first port of call will always be Google, especially for Foundations, someone has probably had my problem and solved it before. Secondly I would contact my cohort through the Slack channels. Failing that I would get in touch directly with my facilitator, Engie, through slack.

                <p>
                    Support when needed during business hours, especially through the main channels - slack and email. I imagine they can give a wide range of support from bugs in my code, to needing to adjust my learning journey because of personal problems, to restaurant recommendations.

                    I have no other commitments currently, but in February I will be starting a Te Reo course from 12th February on Tuesday evenings from 6pm-9pm. I may need to leave Dev Academy slightly earlier on Tuesdays.
