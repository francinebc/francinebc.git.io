                <h5 class="text-center">What are the differences between HTML and CSS?</h5>
                <p>
                    The very basic relationship between HTML and CSS is that CSS makes the content you put on the page which is created using HTML look pretty. You use HTML to tell the browser wht to put on the page, what the headers will be, what wil be inside of the paragraphs, what images and links there will be. If you are making a birthday card for your friend then HTML is all the stuff you want to say in your card like "Happy Birthday!" and maybe a picture of some balloons. Without CSS, all the stuff you want to put in your birthday card is going to be clumped up together at the top of the first page. In image 1 you can see what this website's header bar would look like without any CSS. 
                </p>
                <figure class="centered-image text-center">
                    <img src="../images/no_css.png" alt="The header bar without any CSS">
                    <figcaption><u>Img. 1</u></figcaption>
                    <figcaption>The header of this website without any CSS</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    CSS can make your birthday card look amazing! You can change the colour of your "Happy Birthday!" message, and put it on the inside not the outside. You can change the size of your images and you can add borders to the images too. CSS is what you use to tell the HTML (the content) what to look like.

                <!--Q2-->
                <h5 class="text-center">What is the control flow and what are loops?</h5>
                <p>
                    Both the control flow and loops are elements of Javascript which is a coding language used to make webpages interactive rather than just something to look at (which is all HTML and CSS does). Thinking about it in terms of morning routines, the control flow is the flow of activities you perform to get ready for work:
                </p>
                <ol class="text-center centered-image">
                    <li>Wake up</li>
                    <li>Eat breakfast</li>
                    <li>Brush teeth</li>
                </ol>
                <p> 
                    Sometimes the control flow is interrupted. When you wake up you check the time and you woke up late! Now your control flow is changed because you have to skip breakfast. If you woke up on time then you would follow the normal order of things. When you think about it each activity is made up of smaller actions, brushing your teeth is really doing the same thing over and over until your mouth is clean, eating your breakfast is putting food into your mouth over and over until your bowl is empty. Brushing your teeth and eating breakfast can both be described as loops, something that you do over and over until a condition is met.

                <!--Q3-->
                <h5 class="text-center">What is the DOM and how do we interact with it?</h5>
                <p>
                    DOM stands for Document Object Model and represents the page you are looking at when you have your browser open. The DOM thinks of everything on the page as a node or a child of a node. Every <em>div</em>, <em>h1</em>, or <em>p</em> element on the page is a child of a parent. Similar to a tree where every twig branches off, starting from the trunk. Because the DOM represents everything on a webpage we can use the DOM to access elements on the page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe there is an image on your page and when someone clicks on that image you want a box to pop up and show the image in full size. We can use the DOM to access that image and change the page when an event happens (clicking on the page).
                </p>
                <ol class="text-center centered-image">
                    <li>Find the image using the DOM</li>
                    <li>Tell your code to look for clicks on that image</li>
                    <li>When someone clicks on that image, tel the DOM you want add a new element - the image at full size.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    If there is no DOM then there is no way that your javascript code can find the image and look for clicks on the image. HTML builds the DOM and the DOM allows Javascript to access the elements on the page.

                <!--Q4-->
                <h5 class="text-center">What is the difference between accessing data from arrays and from objects?</h5>
                <p>
                    Arrays and objects are both ways of storing data in Javascript, except that objects are more powerful. Data stored in an array can only be accessed by its index. For example if we have this array: 
                </p>
                <p class="text-center"><b>var myArray = [[0, "Hello"], [1,"World"], [2, "!"]];</b></p>
                <p>To access "Hello" we would need to say: myArray[0][1], that is the 0th (first) array of myArray at the 1th (second) position.</p>
