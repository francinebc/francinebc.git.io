                <h5>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h5>
                <p>
                    Emotional intelligence one of the many intelligences humans have, such as spatial intelligence, physical intelligence and the classical "good at maths" intelligence. Emotional intelligence is about how in touch you are with yourself and the inner workings of your mind. Someone with high emotional intelligence will also understand others and their feelings, they feel empathy for fellow humans. Those with high emotional intelligence know that while humans are all different with different morals, hopes, traumas, and opinions, we are all fundamentally the same - we all desire acceptance and love.

                <h5>How is it different to IQ?</h5>
                <p>
                    IQ or intelligence quotient is generally a measure of someone's intelligence based on their mathematical and pattern finding abilities. Someone who can find patterns between shapes, numbers and words usually have a higher IQ than those who either cannot or take longer to do this. EQ (emotional intelligence) ius not measured by how many puzzles you solve but by how aware you are of your own thoughts and feelings and those of the people around you.

                <h5>Why is it important?</h5>
                <p>
                    There is a lot of proof that those with a higher EQ are happier and achieve more in their careers. This is especially important because emotional intelligence is something that can be improved through practice. If we can become more emotionally intelligent then we can improve the quality of our lives.
