                <h5>What impact has the core learning had on my Foundations learning journey?</h5>
                <p>
                    The core learning has helped me look internally and find some of the reasons why I behave and think in certain ways. Because I know a little bit more about why I am the way I am, I am empowered to change.

                <!--Q2-->
                <h5>What have I learned about myself as a result of the core learning?</h5>
                <p>
                    I have learned that I have a fixed mindset for some things and a growth mindset for others. Learning about the two mindsets gave me an insight into how I can reach my full potential. Introducing myself to my peers really highlighted how shy I am to share personal information with anyone especially strangers. I always thought of myself as an open book but I now realise that I am only an open book to my very close family. Mostly the core learning taught me about myself, and broke down a lot of misconceptions I had held.

                <!--Q3-->
                <h5>What surprised me about the core learning?</h5>
                <p>
                    In some ways I am resistant to change, especially when it comes to things emotional because I have of emotional baggage. The core learning was focussed around us and we needed to go out and find what we could. Because of this style of learning I was more receptive and gave myself more freedom to think that I can change by my own volition. This was the most surprising part for me because I was expecting myself to disregard or disagree with the material for fear of change.

                <!--Q4-->
                <h5>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h5>
                <p>
                    Definitely the meditation from Sprint 3. Because of past trauma, trying to meditate or practice mindfulness in a completely serene quiet environment is very difficult. When my mind goes clear, other things come up that are usually repressed. I have been trying to practice mindfulness while doing something else, such as cooking, embroidery or spending quiet time where I feel most safe - beside my partner.
