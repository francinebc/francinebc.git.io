                <h5>What is Neuroplasticity?</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change throughout an individual's life, learning new languages, instruments, thought and behavioral patterns. Knowing that your brain can change is empowering, if we want to be smarter, or know how to speak French, or recover from a stroke, brain change is achievable. Knowing that I can change my thinking and build knowledge will motivate me to dig deeper during my time at Dev Academy and beyond. This <a href="https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/neuroplasticity/">article</a> from Positive Psychology Programme suggests a few different methods I could try to trigger neuroplasticity. Something that has worked well for me before is mnemonic devices, these are excellent to help with learning a language and I will use these again when I start Te Reo courses in February. Apparently learning a new subject is also great for encouraging neuroplasticity which is very handy seeing as I am in the middle of learning a large complex subject with Dev Academy.

                <h5>What is Growth Mindset?</h5>
                <p>
                    A growth mindset is the idea that we can improve ourselves through effort. Opposing the growth mindset is the fixed mindset - that we are born with innate abilities that will not change regardless of whether we try or not. A growth mindset should be adopted when we realise that we can take advantage of neuroplasticity, once you know you can change then you can follow through with the actions that will lead to change. Reading about the growth mindset made me think about where my mindset is, and I think in many cases it has been fixed. Some things, such as learning a language or an instrument, I have always thought I could so long as I put the effort in. Other things, such as sports or applying makeup, I have always put into the, "I will never be good at this" category. I don't know why I have different mindsets for different tasks, in future I need to think about why I feel that I could never learn something especially if it is something that I have motivation to learn anyway because it is fun or interesting. Positive Psychology Programme's <a href="https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/growth-mindset-vs-fixed-mindset/">article</a> about the growth mindset was also very informative with some concrete ways that I can try to change my mindset. Some of these really apply to me such as "valuing the learning process over the end result" and "taking risks and being vulnerable with others" which I will try to keep in mind moving forward.

                <h5>How will Neuroplasticty and Growth Mindset blend with my learning plan?</h5>
                <p>
                    Learning about neuroplasticity and the growth mindset has given me some fuel for introspection and my beliefs about my own abilities. The biggest take away is to engage more and take more risks as this will help me succeed. I have nothing to lose by asking a "stupid" question to my peers, I have everything to gain by trying to push myself further even though I might fail.
