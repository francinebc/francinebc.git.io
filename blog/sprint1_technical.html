                    I was visiting a friend, Shelly, in Wellington. While we were there Shelly's neighbour and long-time friend Anne was also visiting. Anne was telling me about the neighbour a few houses down who was an elderly lady. While we were all visiting Shelly’s house, we could hear a car pull up, and then banging and shouting coming from the elderly lady’s house. Anne told me that this happened on a regular basis, the culprit of the banging and yelling was the elderly women’s son.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anne asked me if she should do anything, this had been going on for some time and she was worried, but up until now nobody had done anything. In Shelly’s opinion we should not interfere because it was not our business. Truthfully, I was shocked that no one had said or done anything.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was an outsider in this situation, I did not know the people involved and I did not really know the full story. Shelly thought we should all stay out of it, but I called the police because I have been through domestic violence myself and I could not let it go. 
                </p>
                <p>        
                    I explained the situation to the police as well as I could but really I did not know enough of the details. Anne was scared of talking to the police and getting herself involved, but I put her on the spot and gave her no choice. I either hung up on the police or she had to take over and answer their questions. I don’t know if what I did was right. I knew in the end that Anne would have to get involved even though she didn't want to, and I called the police anyway. All I could think at the time was that someone needed to know what was happening, and there needed to be a record incase of future incidents. 
                </p>
                <p>        
                    In my experience the police have always been very friendly, helpful and understanding. When they came around, they were just that, they spoke with Anne and they spoke with the elderly woman.  
                </p>
                <p>            
                    Shelly was upset with me for the rest of the day and would only give me one-word answers. I never heard what happened and I have not asked because it was many years ago now. It is not the first time I have reported suspected domestic abuse, as far as I am concerned someone’s problem is also mine and our society’s problems. I don’t believe in being nosy but turning a blind eye is just accepting that abuse is OK. When I was younger, and I was being abused by my family I always wondered why no one noticed. Now I think that perhaps they did, they just did not have courage to do anything.

                        New Zealand culture is predominantly a Christian culture although I am not myself Christian. I never realised this more than when I travelled through Asian and saw a predominantly Confucianism culture. My culture is for self-interest and society interest, as opposed to Confucianism which is based around family interests.

                    <p> 
                        I will always put my wants and needs before anything else and that is seen as natural here, then comes the needs of those around me. Charity, giving back and equality are important pillars of my culture and when I fail these, I feel a deep failing in myself. I try to be charitable in as many ways as I can, with my time, my help, my money, and I think most importantly my empathy. I try to see, understand and feel everyone’s side to the story. All problems are problems of our society, and we all responsible for finding and administrating the remedies. 
                    </p>
                    <p>        
                        Our culture still values men more than women and white people more than other coloured people, and although we are all trying to improve this it still affects my choices, words, actions, opinions and feelings more than what I dream of for our next generations. I was raised by parents who believed in equality but did not practice what they preach. Sometimes I have to stop myself and think if what I am doing aligns with my beliefs or if I am mimicking what I saw when I was young. Because of this I am 'intolerant of intolerance', as Karl Popper says.

                        Growing up I was told by my family that I was Maori. When I was around 13 and I was the only white girl in my school’s kapahaka I realised that this was not true. I also realised I was not quite Pakeha either. I cannot speak Maori but I know many waiata, I cannot recite the Gods but I can weave simple flax and I know simple Marae protocol. But I am just a New Zealander. Another person from our country with many mixed heritages, whose upbringing was affected by many cultures. I can Indian dance and make traditional poi, I can make Kimchi and I can embroider.

                        My strengths for my future career lie in my solid background in tech with a degree in computer science. My best soft skills are my empathy, my encouragement of my pears and my desire to hear everyone’s opinion.

                        My biggest limitations for my career will probably be that I am very blunt when speaking to people. I try not to be but even when I think I am being gentle others perceive this as very direct. Some people appreciate this, but others find it intimidating, unfriendly or in bad taste. I also don’t have much confidence in myself technically, so I do not put myself forward.

                        I am a problem solver, constantly thinking how I can fix an issue with the resources that I have. When I have a problem, I take a break and come at the issue from another angle, I keep trying all the different ways of fixing an issue until it is resolved. I do not give up easily, I try to look for easier solutions when something is getting more difficult than it should.

I am not afraid of speaking out and speaking my mind.

                        While I was teaching English in Korea, I had an open class with one of my Korean co-teachers. An open class is where your classroom is open for upper management of the public schooling system and other teachers to come and view your teaching methods. My co-teacher and I made a lesson plan and rigorously picked over every detail, as this was the basis for our job review. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We came to heads many times because there were cultural differences between how we thought a lesson should be run. My co-teacher wanted to include more drilling while I was worried more about lesson flow and wanted to give students more active speaking time.  
                    </p>
                    <p>      
                        We discussed how we both wanted the lesson to be but my co-teacher did not agree with me. A mentor came to help plan our lesson before the big day. She pointed out the lesson did not flow well and had too much drilling. I came up with a compromise, students would drill whole conversations with picture cards and they could choose from which card they could read the conversation from. The students were drilling English and practising their conversation. Our open class was a big success and we won an award.  
                    </p>
                    <p>      
                        A year later I had to plan another open class with a different co-teacher. This co-teacher was very hands off and as per our normal lessons together, wanted me to direct 90% of the class. The goal is for 50/50 direction between Korean teacher and Native English teacher. I suggested that we should be teaching more equally but once again my co-teacher disagreed with me. This time the mentor only met with my co-teacher and not with me also. 
                    </p>
                    <p>       
                        After our open class my co-teacher was slammed by our administration for her bad teaching habits because she was not present for 90% of the lesson. She was very upset about this, but I had tried to tell her what was expected as I had given an open class more recently than her, but she ignored me. 
                    </p>
                    <p>       
                        Sometimes we have no say in how things will turn out, we can only give our input. A Native English teacher in Korea is at the very bottom of the school hierarchy. My co-teachers were not being rude, they just thought I was wrong and that was the end of it. I think even in those situations it is still important to try to compromise and to try to voice your opinions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>       
                        What I learned from those two experiences is that if someone will not listen to me or even if I will not listen to someone else, try to get a second opinion from someone you both trust, who is impartial to the situation. If during my second open class, we had spoken with a mentor together we may have had another successful open class.
