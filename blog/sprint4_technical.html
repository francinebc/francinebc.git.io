                <h5>A story about a time I got blocked on a simple problem.</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    I was trying to find out what door Scooby was hiding behind in a house, and to me the method looked perfect. But my computer kept saying "error! - your house does not have any doors!" which is silly because all houses have doors! To solve the problem I put console log statements at crucial parts in my method to tell me exactly where the doors were disappearing. After reading my console log statements I found the problem, someone had been asking me to look for Scooby on a patch of land that did not even have a house in it. Once I could check that the houses I was searching were actually houses with doors the issue was resolved. Trying to find why my doors didn't exist was a simple problem and it was frustrating but once I knew what the problem was I could solve it quickly. I leaned from this experience to always be wary when writing code that other coders on the project might pass you values that you don't expect.

                <h5>A story about a time I solved a problem in an elegant way.</h5>
                <p>
                    I needed to read a sentence and through away all the "buzz" words in the sentence, but sometimes "buzz" was spelt "BuZZ", "buZZ", or "BUzZ". when I compared the words in a sentence to "buzz" I also had to compare them to all the different uppercase and lowercase varieties of "buzz". I knew that in Java there was a method where you could compare strings ignoring the case of the strings, so I turned to Google to find out if there was a similar solution in Javascript. From a quick Google search I found that there was no equalIgnoreCase() or similar method in Javascript. What I did find was a suggestion from a user to first capitalize both words and then compare. All I needed to do to check if I was keeping the word was: <br><code>word.toUpperCase() != "BUZZ"</code>. This problem was solved quickly through a simple Google search so I felt relieved that I could sort it out and move on. This reiterated for me that often for simple problems there will be a simple solution out there that someone has already found.

                <h5>How confident do I feel using problem solving techniques and processes?</h5>
                <ul class = "text-left">
                    <li><b>Pseudocode</b> - <em>High</em> - I have been using pseudocode for a long time, even for things that are not programming, like planning a wedding!</li>
                    <li><b>Trying something</b> - <em>High</em> - I always try to attack problems from different angles, this is my preferred method of problem solving. I usually try this before I get into extensive problem solving for a misbehaving line of code.</li>
                    <li><b>Rubber ducky method</b> - <em>Low</em> - It just feels weird to talk about my problems to an inanimate object, especially if other people are listening.</li>
                    <li><b>Reading error messages</b> - <em>Medium</em> - While they are useful for telling you were the code broke often the messages themselves don not contain any useful information because the problem did not actually start where the code broke.</li>
                    <li><b>Console.logging</b> - <em>High</em> - This is usually my very first technique I try and it easy to print a line of code out even if it is just to let you know that a a for loop was entered for example.</li>
                    <li><b>Googling</b> - <em>High/Medium</em> - The effectiveness of Googling really depends on the problem. If I need to ask, "How do I get the time in Javascript?" that is easier to find a solution on Google than, "My server does not load images of cats on Tuesday afternoons, dogs are OK though".</li>
                    <li><b>Asking your peers for help</b> - <em>Medium</em> - My peers are very helpful and active on Slack but explaining a problem over text without the full context makes it hard for them to help fully. I also don't want to bother my peers too much.</li>
                    <li><b>Asking coaches for help</b> - <em>Medium</em> - This is difficult for the same reasons as when asking a peer for help.</li>
                    <li><b>Improving your process with reflection</b> - <em>Hard</em> - My memory is like a sieve so reflecting is difficult for me. Usually I have to go back and read over what I did to even remember what my issues/successes were. Hopefully this is something that will get better with time.</li>
                </ul>
