                <h5>A story about a time I got blocked on a simple problem.</h5>
                <p>
                    I was trying to find out what door Scooby was hiding behind in a house, and to me the method looked perfect. But my computer kept saying "error! - your house does not have any doors!" which is silly because all houses have doors! To solve the problem I put console log statements at crucial parts in my method to tell me exactly where the doors were disappearing. After reading my console log statements I found the problem, someone had been asking me to look for Scooby on a patch of land that did not even have a house in it. Once I could check that the houses I was searching were actually houses with doors the issue was resolved. Trying to find why my doors didn't exist was a simple problem and it was frustrating but once I knew what the problem was I could solve it quickly. I leaned from this experience to always be wary when writing code that other coders on the project might pass you values that you don't expect.
